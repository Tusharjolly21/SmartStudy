                India’s Geography encompasses one of the world’s most diverse
                land layouts. India is the Country that occupies most of the
                <span className="font-bold"> Indian subcontinent </span>in
                Southern Asia. These diverse features make India one of the best
                topographic regions. In this chapter we are going to discuss the
                physical features of the Indian Subcontinent which includes its
                geographical extent, the different frontiers and the shared
                boundaries of our nation. We will also discuss the surrounding
                oceans, political divisions and the geological structure which
                comprises this huge sub continent.
