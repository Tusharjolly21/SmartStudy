                secures a unique position across the world concerning its

                vast dimension of the country, like the lofty young fold

                  provide a huge tourism scope due to its scenic beauty and
                  healthy environment. Several tourist spots are found in the
                  Himalayas, such as{" "}

                  etc. The interest in these spots is due to the calm and

                  <span className="font-bold">Minerals:</span> The Himalayas, as
                  we know, are the result of sediments deposited by rivers in
                  the Tethys Sea. Along with this deposition, thousands of
                  fossils are buried, which exist today in the form of minerals.
                  The Himalayan region contains many valuable minerals. The
                  tertiary rocks are endowed with massive potential mineral
                  oils. Other minerals such as{" "}
                  <span className="font-bold">
                    copper, limestone gold, nickel, and silver,

                  among others, are known to be abundant.
